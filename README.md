Descriotion of the App:

App Description

The Mystery Number Challenge is a mobile guessing game built with React Native. The app generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the app gives feedback — telling the user if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The app also tracks the number of attempts and includes a restart button to play again.

Game Flow

When the app starts, a random number (1–100) is generated.
The user types a number guess in the input field.
After pressing “Guess”, the app responds: Too high if the guess is greater than the secret number Too low if the guess is less than the secret number Correct! if the guess matches
The number of guesses is updated after each attempt.
Pressing "Restart" resets the game with a new secret number and guess count.
Group Reflection:

We designed the app based on our previous console version, then mapped out the UI using React Native components. We learned how to manage state with useState, handle user input, and build interactive mobile apps. The main challenge was handling and validating user input, which we solved by using simple checks and resetting the input after each guess. Our group collaborated by dividing tasks — one handled UI, another focused on logic, and we reviewed each other's work regularly.

Features Random Number Generator – Picks a number from 1 to 100 at the start or restart. User Guess Input – Players enter guesses using a TextInput. Feedback – App shows “Too high,” “Too low,” or “Correct!” after each guess. Guess Counter – Tracks and displays the number of attempts. Restart Button – Resets the game with a new number and guess count.
